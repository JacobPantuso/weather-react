<h3>What is Weather React?</h3>
<b>Weather React</b> is a data-driven weather webpage built with ReactJS. It uses <a href="https://openweathermap.org">OpenWeatherAPI</a> to fetch the weather of the current location of the user.
<hr>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>When a user vists the webpage they will be prompted to share their location. Their location data is sent to the API and the weather data is displayed. The location is stored in local storage for blazing fast response times with the API. A users location is <b>never</b> stored externally or shared with third-parties. It will be made to use the request to the API and stored in the local cache of the browser being used.</p>
